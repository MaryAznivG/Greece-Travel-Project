   <h2> Why Greece?</h2>
    <h3>Greece has more than 18 UNESCO Heritage-listed sites </h3>
    <p>
       The capital of Greece is named after the goddess Athena, the goddess of wisdom and warfare. According to Greek Mythology, Athena and Poseidon fought over the right to name the city by offering gifts to the citizens, and the Greeks chose Athena to
    be the Patron of Athens. Because Athena planted a seed in the ground, that grew up to be a lovely olive tree. And the citizens liked this gift better due to it provided them food, oil, and firewood. Futhermore, Athens has 148 theatrical stages, more than any other city in the world, even beating out London‚Äôs West End and New York‚Äôs Broadway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Futhermore, Greece is famous for it's amazing beaches and beautilful cycladic architecture. Greece beaches are beautilful, clear blue color, to swim in and where you can find a good place to lay down and get a tan. Greece has nice Mediterranean restaurants where there is live Greek music is played and mostly you will see
      them playing the "Bouzouki". "The bouzouki, also spelled buzuki or buzuci, is a musical instrument popular in Greece. It is a member of the
      long-necked lute family, with a round body with a flat top and a long neck with a fretted fingerboard." It's string instrument. While they do their 
      traditional dances or dance they break plates, for happiness, celebration and can ward off evil spirits.
      Also, there are over 10,000 traditional dances that come from all regions of Greece. Opa!
